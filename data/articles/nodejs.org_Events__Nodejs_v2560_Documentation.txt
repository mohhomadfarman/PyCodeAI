Title: Events | Node.js v25.6.0 Documentation
Source: https://nodejs.org/api/events.html

Source Code: lib/events.js

Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous
event-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters")
emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called.

For instance: a net.Server object emits an event each time a peer
connects to it; a fs.ReadStream emits an event when the file is opened;
a stream emits an event whenever data is available to be read.

All objects that emit events are instances of the EventEmitter class. These
objects expose an eventEmitter.on() function that allows one or more
functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object. Typically,
event names are camel-cased strings but any valid JavaScript property key
can be used.

When the EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the functions attached
to that specific event are called synchronously. Any values returned by the
called listeners are ignored and discarded.

The following example shows a simple EventEmitter instance with a single
listener. The eventEmitter.on() method is used to register listeners, while
the eventEmitter.emit() method is used to trigger the event.

The eventEmitter.emit() method allows an arbitrary set of arguments to be
passed to the listener functions. Keep in mind that when
an ordinary listener function is called, the standard this keyword
is intentionally set to reference the EventEmitter instance to which the
listener is attached.

It is possible to use ES6 Arrow Functions as listeners, however, when doing so,
the this keyword will no longer reference the EventEmitter instance:

The EventEmitter calls all listeners synchronously in the order in which
they were registered. This ensures the proper sequencing of
events and helps avoid race conditions and logic errors. When appropriate,
listener functions can switch to an asynchronous mode of operation using
the setImmediate() or process.nextTick() methods:

When a listener is registered using the eventEmitter.on() method, that
listener is invoked every time the named event is emitted.

Using the eventEmitter.once() method, it is possible to register a listener
that is called at most once for a particular event. Once the event is emitted,
the listener is unregistered and then called.

When an error occurs within an EventEmitter instance, the typical action is
for an 'error' event to be emitted. These are treated as special cases
within Node.js.

If an EventEmitter does not have at least one listener registered for the
'error' event, and an 'error' event is emitted, the error is thrown, a
stack trace is printed, and the Node.js process exits.

To guard against crashing the Node.js process the domain module can be
used. (Note, however, that the node:domain module is deprecated.)

As a best practice, listeners should always be added for the 'error' events.

It is possible to monitor 'error' events without consuming the emitted error
by installing a listener using the symbol events.errorMonitor.

Using async functions with event handlers is problematic, because it
can lead to an unhandled rejection in case of a thrown exception:

The captureRejections option in the EventEmitter constructor or the global
setting change this behavior, installing a .then(undefined, handler)
handler on the Promise. This handler routes the exception
asynchronously to the Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection') method
if there is one, or to 'error' event handler if there is none.

Setting events.captureRejections = true will change the default for all
new instances of EventEmitter.

The 'error' events that are generated by the captureRejections behavior
do not have a catch handler to avoid infinite error loops: the
recommendation is to not use async functions as 'error' event handlers.

Added captureRejections option.

Added in: v0.1.26

The EventEmitter class is defined and exposed by the node:events module:

All EventEmitters emit the event 'newListener' when new listeners are
added and 'removeListener' when existing listeners are removed.

It supports the following option:

The EventEmitter instance will emit its own 'newListener' event before
a listener is added to its internal array of listeners.

Listeners registered for the 'newListener' event are passed the event
name and a reference to the listener being added.

The fact that the event is triggered before adding the listener has a subtle
but important side effect: any additional listeners registered to the same
name within the 'newListener' callback are inserted before the
listener that is in the process of being added.

For listeners attached using .once(), the listener argument now yields the original listener function.

Added in: v0.9.3

The 'removeListener' event is emitted after the listener is removed.

Alias for emitter.on(eventName, listener).

Synchronously calls each of the listeners registered for the event named
eventName, in the order they were registered, passing the supplied arguments
to each.

Returns true if the event had listeners, false otherwise.

Returns an array listing the events for which the emitter has registered
listeners.

Returns the current max listener value for the EventEmitter which is either
set by emitter.setMaxListeners(n) or defaults to
events.defaultMaxListeners.

Added the listener argument.

Added in: v3.2.0

Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named eventName.
If listener is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found
in the list of the listeners of the event.

For listeners attached using .once() this returns the original listeners instead of wrapper functions now.

Added in: v0.1.26

Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named eventName.

Alias for emitter.removeListener().

Adds the listener function to the end of the listeners array for the
event named eventName. No checks are made to see if the listener has
already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of eventName
and listener will result in the listener being added, and called, multiple
times.

Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The
emitter.prependListener() method can be used as an alternative to add the
event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

Adds a one-time listener function for the event named eventName. The
next time eventName is triggered, this listener is removed and then invoked.

Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The
emitter.prependOnceListener() method can be used as an alternative to add the
event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

Adds the listener function to the beginning of the listeners array for the
event named eventName. No checks are made to see if the listener has
already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of eventName
and listener will result in the listener being added, and called, multiple
times.

Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

Adds a one-time listener function for the event named eventName to the
beginning of the listeners array. The next time eventName is triggered, this
listener is removed, and then invoked.

Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

Removes all listeners, or those of the specified eventName.

It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code,
particularly when the EventEmitter instance was created by some other
component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

Removes the specified listener from the listener array for the event named
eventName.

removeListener() will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
listener array for the specified eventName, then removeListener() must be
called multiple times to remove each instance.

Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the
time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any
removeListener() or removeAllListeners() calls after emitting and
before the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from
emit() in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will
change the position indexes of any listener registered after the listener
being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called,
but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by
the emitter.listeners() method will need to be recreated.

When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single
event (as in the example below), removeListener() will remove the most
recently added instance. In the example the once('ping')
listener is removed:

Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are
added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding
memory leaks. The emitter.setMaxListeners() method allows the limit to be
modified for this specific EventEmitter instance. The value can be set to
Infinity (or 0) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named eventName,
including any wrappers (such as those created by .once()).

No longer experimental.

Added in: v13.4.0, v12.16.0

The Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection') method is called in case a
promise rejection happens when emitting an event and
captureRejections is enabled on the emitter.
It is possible to use events.captureRejectionSymbol in
place of Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection').

By default, a maximum of 10 listeners can be registered for any single
event. This limit can be changed for individual EventEmitter instances
using the emitter.setMaxListeners(n) method. To change the default
for all EventEmitter instances, the events.defaultMaxListeners
property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a RangeError
is thrown.

Take caution when setting the events.defaultMaxListeners because the
change affects all EventEmitter instances, including those created before
the change is made. However, calling emitter.setMaxListeners(n) still has
precedence over events.defaultMaxListeners.

This is not a hard limit. The EventEmitter instance will allow
more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating
that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single
EventEmitter, the emitter.getMaxListeners() and emitter.setMaxListeners()
methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning:

defaultMaxListeners has no effect on AbortSignal instances. While it is
still possible to use emitter.setMaxListeners(n) to set a warning limit
for individual AbortSignal instances, per default AbortSignal instances will not warn.

The --trace-warnings command-line flag can be used to display the
stack trace for such warnings.

The emitted warning can be inspected with process.on('warning') and will
have the additional emitter, type, and count properties, referring to
the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached
listeners, respectively.
Its name property is set to 'MaxListenersExceededWarning'.

This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring 'error'
events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular
'error' listeners are called.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an
'error' event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no
regular 'error' listener is installed.

Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named eventName.

For EventEmitters this behaves exactly the same as calling .listeners on
the emitter.

For EventTargets this is the only way to get the event listeners for the
event target. This is useful for debugging and diagnostic purposes.

Returns the currently set max amount of listeners.

For EventEmitters this behaves exactly the same as calling .getMaxListeners on
the emitter.

For EventTargets this is the only way to get the max event listeners for the
event target. If the number of event handlers on a single EventTarget exceeds
the max set, the EventTarget will print a warning.

The signal option is supported now.

Added in: v11.13.0, v10.16.0

Creates a Promise that is fulfilled when the EventEmitter emits the given
event or that is rejected if the EventEmitter emits 'error' while waiting.
The Promise will resolve with an array of all the arguments emitted to the
given event.

This method is intentionally generic and works with the web platform
EventTarget interface, which has no special
'error' event semantics and does not listen to the 'error' event.

The special handling of the 'error' event is only used when events.once()
is used to wait for another event. If events.once() is used to wait for the
'error' event itself, then it is treated as any other kind of event without
special handling:

An <AbortSignal> can be used to cancel waiting for the event:

There is an edge case worth noting when using the events.once() function
to await multiple events emitted on in the same batch of process.nextTick()
operations, or whenever multiple events are emitted synchronously. Specifically,
because the process.nextTick() queue is drained before the Promise microtask
queue, and because EventEmitter emits all events synchronously, it is possible
for events.once() to miss an event.

To catch both events, create each of the Promises before awaiting either
of them, then it becomes possible to use Promise.all(), Promise.race(),
or Promise.allSettled():

No longer experimental.

Added in: v13.4.0, v12.16.0

Change the default captureRejections option on all new EventEmitter objects.

No longer experimental.

See how to write a custom rejection handler.

Now accepts EventTarget arguments.

Deprecation revoked.

Documentation-only deprecation.

Added in: v0.9.12

Returns the number of registered listeners for the event named eventName.

For EventEmitters this behaves exactly the same as calling .listenerCount
on the emitter.

For EventTargets this is the only way to obtain the listener count. This can
be useful for debugging and diagnostic purposes.

Support highWaterMark and lowWaterMark options, For consistency. Old options are still supported.

The close, highWatermark, and lowWatermark options are supported now.

Added in: v13.6.0, v12.16.0

Returns an AsyncIterator that iterates eventName events. It will throw
if the EventEmitter emits 'error'. It removes all listeners when
exiting the loop. The value returned by each iteration is an array
composed of the emitted event arguments.

An <AbortSignal> can be used to cancel waiting on events:

Change stability index for this feature from Experimental to Stable.

Added in: v20.5.0, v18.18.0

Listens once to the abort event on the provided signal.

Listening to the abort event on abort signals is unsafe and may
lead to resource leaks since another third party with the signal can
call e.stopImmediatePropagation(). Unfortunately Node.js cannot change
this since it would violate the web standard. Additionally, the original
API makes it easy to forget to remove listeners.

This API allows safely using AbortSignals in Node.js APIs by solving these
two issues by listening to the event such that stopImmediatePropagation does
not prevent the listener from running.

Returns a disposable so that it may be unsubscribed from more easily.

Integrates EventEmitter with <AsyncResource> for EventEmitters that
require manual async tracking. Specifically, all events emitted by instances
of events.EventEmitterAsyncResource will run within its async context.

The EventEmitterAsyncResource class has the same methods and takes the
same options as EventEmitter and AsyncResource themselves.

The returned AsyncResource object has an additional eventEmitter property
that provides a reference to this EventEmitterAsyncResource.

Call all destroy hooks. This should only ever be called once. An error will
be thrown if it is called more than once. This must be manually called. If
the resource is left to be collected by the GC then the destroy hooks will
never be called.

changed EventTarget error handling.

No longer experimental.

The EventTarget and Event classes are now available as globals.

Added in: v14.5.0

The EventTarget and Event objects are a Node.js-specific implementation
of the EventTarget Web API that are exposed by some Node.js core APIs.

There are two key differences between the Node.js EventTarget and the
EventTarget Web API:

The NodeEventTarget object implements a modified subset of the
EventEmitter API that allows it to closely emulate an EventEmitter in
certain situations. A NodeEventTarget is not an instance of EventEmitter
and cannot be used in place of an EventEmitter in most cases.

Event listeners registered for an event type may either be JavaScript
functions or objects with a handleEvent property whose value is a function.

In either case, the handler function is invoked with the event argument
passed to the eventTarget.dispatchEvent() function.

Async functions may be used as event listeners. If an async handler function
rejects, the rejection is captured and handled as described in
EventTarget error handling.

An error thrown by one handler function does not prevent the other handlers
from being invoked.

The return value of a handler function is ignored.

Handlers are always invoked in the order they were added.

Handler functions may mutate the event object.

When a registered event listener throws (or returns a Promise that rejects),
by default the error is treated as an uncaught exception on
process.nextTick(). This means uncaught exceptions in EventTargets will
terminate the Node.js process by default.

Throwing within an event listener will not stop the other registered handlers
from being invoked.

The EventTarget does not implement any special default handling for 'error'
type events like EventEmitter.

Currently errors are first forwarded to the process.on('error') event
before reaching process.on('uncaughtException'). This behavior is
deprecated and will change in a future release to align EventTarget with
other Node.js APIs. Any code relying on the process.on('error') event should
be aligned with the new behavior.

The Event class is now available through the global object.

Added in: v14.5.0

The Event object is an adaptation of the Event Web API. Instances
are created internally by Node.js.

This is not used in Node.js and is provided purely for completeness.

Alias for event.stopPropagation() if set to true. This is not used
in Node.js and is provided purely for completeness.

This is not used in Node.js and is provided purely for completeness.

Returns an array containing the current EventTarget as the only entry or
empty if the event is not being dispatched. This is not used in
Node.js and is provided purely for completeness.

called.

This is not used in Node.js and is provided purely for completeness.

Redundant with event constructors and incapable of setting composed.
This is not used in Node.js and is provided purely for completeness.

The <AbortSignal> "abort" event is emitted with isTrusted set to true. The
value is false in all other cases.

Sets the defaultPrevented property to true if cancelable is true.

The value of event.returnValue is always the opposite of event.defaultPrevented.

Added in: v14.5.0

add support for signal option.

Added in: v14.5.0

Adds a new handler for the type event. Any given listener is added
only once per type and per capture option value.

If the once option is true, the listener is removed after the
next time a type event is dispatched.

The capture option is not used by Node.js in any functional way other than
tracking registered event listeners per the EventTarget specification.
Specifically, the capture option is used as part of the key when registering
a listener. Any individual listener may be added once with
capture = false, and once with capture = true.

Dispatches the event to the list of handlers for event.type.

The registered event listeners is synchronously invoked in the order they
were registered.

Removes the listener from the list of handlers for event type.

No longer experimental.

CustomEvent is now stable.
