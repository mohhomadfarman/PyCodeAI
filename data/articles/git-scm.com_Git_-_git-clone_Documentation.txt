git-clone - Clone a repository into a new directory

Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates
remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
(visible using git branch --remotes), and creates and checks out an
initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s
currently active branch.

After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update
all the remote-tracking branches, and a git pull without
arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch into the
current master branch, if any (this is untrue when --single-branch
is given; see below).

This default configuration is achieved by creating references to
the remote branch heads under refs/remotes/origin and
by initializing remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch
configuration variables.

When the repository to clone from is on a local machine,
this flag bypasses the normal "Git aware" transport
mechanism and clones the repository by making a copy of
HEAD and everything under objects and refs directories.
The files under .git/objects/ directory are hardlinked
to save space when possible.

If the repository is specified as a local path (e.g., /path/to/repo),
this is the default, and --local is essentially a no-op.  If the
repository is specified as a URL, then this flag is ignored (and we
never use the local optimizations).  Specifying --no-local will
override the default when /path/to/repo is given, using the regular
Git transport instead.

If the repository’s $GIT_DIR/objects has symbolic links or is a
symbolic link, the clone will fail. This is a security measure to
prevent the unintentional copying of files by dereferencing the symbolic
links.

This option does not work with repositories owned by other users for security
reasons, and --no-local must be specified for the clone to succeed.

NOTE: this operation can race with concurrent modification to the
source repository, similar to running cp -r <src> <dst> while modifying
<src>.

Force the cloning process from a repository on a local
filesystem to copy the files under the .git/objects
directory instead of using hardlinks. This may be desirable
if you are trying to make a back-up of your repository.

When the repository to clone is on the local machine,
instead of using hard links, automatically setup
.git/objects/info/alternates to share the objects
with the source repository.  The resulting repository
starts out without any object of its own.

NOTE: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do not use
it unless you understand what it does. If you clone your
repository using this option and then delete branches (or use any
other Git command that makes any existing commit unreferenced) in the
source repository, some objects may become unreferenced (or dangling).
These objects may be removed by normal Git operations (such as git commit)
which automatically call git maintenance run --auto. (See
git-maintenance[1].) If these objects are removed and were referenced
by the cloned repository, then the cloned repository will become corrupt.

Note that running git repack without the --local option in a repository
cloned with --shared will copy objects from the source repository into a pack
in the cloned repository, removing the disk space savings of clone --shared.
It is safe, however, to run git gc, which uses the --local option by
default.

If you want to break the dependency of a repository cloned with --shared on
its source repository, you can simply run git repack -a to copy all
objects from the source repository into a pack in the cloned repository.

If the reference <repository> is on the local machine,
automatically setup .git/objects/info/alternates to
obtain objects from the reference <repository>.  Using
an already existing repository as an alternate will
require fewer objects to be copied from the repository
being cloned, reducing network and local storage costs.
When using the --reference-if-able, a non existing
directory is skipped with a warning instead of aborting
the clone.

NOTE: see the NOTE for the --shared option, and also the
--dissociate option.

Borrow the objects from reference repositories specified
with the --reference options only to reduce network
transfer, and stop borrowing from them after a clone is made
by making necessary local copies of borrowed objects.  This
option can also be used when cloning locally from a
repository that already borrows objects from another
repository—​the new repository will borrow objects from the
same repository, and this option can be used to stop the
borrowing.

Operate quietly.  Progress is not reported to the standard
error stream.

Run verbosely. Does not affect the reporting of progress status
to the standard error stream.

Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless --quiet
is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the
standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

Transmit the given string to the server when communicating using
protocol version 2.  The given string must not contain a NUL or LF
character.  The server’s handling of server options, including
unknown ones, is server-specific.
When multiple --server-option=<option> are given, they are all
sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line.
When no --server-option=<option> is given from the command
line, the values of configuration variable remote.<name>.serverOption
are used instead.

No checkout of HEAD is performed after the clone is complete.

Fail if the source repository is a shallow repository.
The clone.rejectShallow configuration variable can be used to
specify the default.

Make a bare Git repository.  That is, instead of
creating <directory> and placing the administrative
files in <directory>/.git, make the <directory>
itself the $GIT_DIR. This obviously implies the --no-checkout
because there is nowhere to check out the working tree.
Also the branch heads at the remote are copied directly
to corresponding local branch heads, without mapping
them to refs/remotes/origin/.  When this option is
used, neither remote-tracking branches nor the related
configuration variables are created.

Employ a sparse-checkout, with only files in the toplevel
directory initially being present.  The
git-sparse-checkout[1] command can be used to grow the
working directory as needed.

Use the partial clone feature and request that the server sends
a subset of reachable objects according to a given object filter.
When using --filter, the supplied <filter-spec> is used for
the partial clone filter. For example, --filter=blob:none will
filter out all blobs (file contents) until needed by Git. Also,
--filter=blob:limit=<size> will filter out all blobs of size
at least <size>. For more details on filter specifications, see
the --filter option in git-rev-list[1].

Also apply the partial clone filter to any submodules in the repository.
Requires --filter and --recurse-submodules. This can be turned on by
default by setting the clone.filterSubmodules config option.

Set up a mirror of the source repository.  This implies --bare.
Compared to --bare, --mirror not only maps local branches of the
source to local branches of the target, it maps all refs (including
remote-tracking branches, notes etc.) and sets up a refspec configuration such
that all these refs are overwritten by a git remote update in the
target repository.

Instead of using the remote name origin to keep track of the upstream
repository, use <name>.  Overrides clone.defaultRemoteName from the
config.

Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed
to by the cloned repository’s HEAD, point to <name> branch
instead. In a non-bare repository, this is the branch that will
be checked out.
--branch can also take tags and detaches the HEAD at that commit
in the resulting repository.

Create a new repository, and fetch the history leading to the given
revision <rev> (and nothing else), without making any remote-tracking
branch, and without making any local branch, and detach HEAD to
<rev>. The argument can be a ref name (e.g. refs/heads/main or
refs/tags/v1.0) that peels down to a commit, or a hexadecimal object
name.
This option is incompatible with --branch and --mirror.

When given, and the repository to clone from is accessed
via ssh, this specifies a non-default path for the command
run on the other end.

Specify the directory from which templates will be used;
(See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of git-init[1].)

Set a configuration variable in the newly-created repository;
this takes effect immediately after the repository is
initialized, but before the remote history is fetched or any
files checked out.  The <key> is in the same format as expected by
git-config[1] (e.g., core.eol=true). If multiple
values are given for the same key, each value will be written to
the config file. This makes it safe, for example, to add
additional fetch refspecs to the origin remote.

Due to limitations of the current implementation, some configuration
variables do not take effect until after the initial fetch and checkout.
Configuration variables known to not take effect are:
remote.<name>.mirror and remote.<name>.tagOpt.  Use the
corresponding --mirror and --no-tags options instead.

Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the
specified number of commits. Implies --single-branch unless
--no-single-branch is given to fetch the histories near the
tips of all branches. If you want to clone submodules shallowly,
also pass --shallow-submodules.

Create a shallow clone with a history after the specified time.

Create a shallow clone with a history, excluding commits
reachable from a specified remote branch or tag.  This option
can be specified multiple times.

Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch,
either specified by the --branch option or the primary
branch remote’s HEAD points at.
Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the
remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the
initial cloning.  If the HEAD at the remote did not point at any
branch when --single-branch clone was made, no remote-tracking
branch is created.

Control whether or not tags will be cloned. When --no-tags is
given, the option will be become permanent by setting the
remote.<remote>.tagOpt=--no-tags configuration. This ensures that
future git pull and git fetch won’t follow any tags. Subsequent
explicit tag fetches will still work (see git-fetch[1]).

By default, tags are cloned and passing --tags is thus typically a
no-op, unless it cancels out a previous --no-tags.

Can be used in conjunction with --single-branch to clone and
maintain a branch with no references other than a single cloned
branch. This is useful e.g. to maintain minimal clones of the default
branch of some repository for search indexing.

After the clone is created, initialize and clone submodules
within based on the provided <pathspec>.  If no =<pathspec> is
provided, all submodules are initialized and cloned.
This option can be given multiple times for pathspecs consisting
of multiple entries.  The resulting clone has submodule.active set to
the provided pathspec, or "." (meaning all submodules) if no
pathspec is provided.

Submodules are initialized and cloned using their default settings. This is
equivalent to running
git submodule update --init --recursive <pathspec> immediately after
the clone is finished. This option is ignored if the cloned repository does
not have a worktree/checkout (i.e. if any of --no-checkout/-n, --bare,
or --mirror is given)

All submodules which are cloned will be shallow with a depth of 1.

All submodules which are cloned will use the status of the submodule’s
remote-tracking branch to update the submodule, rather than the
superproject’s recorded SHA-1. Equivalent to passing --remote to
git submodule update.

Instead of placing the cloned repository where it is supposed
to be, place the cloned repository at the specified directory,
then make a filesystem-agnostic Git symbolic link to there.
The result is Git repository can be separated from working
tree.

Specify the given ref storage format for the repository. The valid values are:

files for loose files with packed-refs. This is the default.

reftable for the reftable format. This format is experimental and its
internals are subject to change.

The number of submodules fetched at the same time.
Defaults to the submodule.fetchJobs option.

The (possibly remote) <repository> to clone from.  See the
GIT URLS section below for more information on specifying
repositories.

The name of a new directory to clone into.  The "humanish"
part of the source repository is used if no <directory> is
explicitly given (repo for /path/to/repo.git and foo
for host.xz:foo/.git).  Cloning into an existing directory
is only allowed if the directory is empty.

Before fetching from the remote, fetch a bundle from the given
<uri> and unbundle the data into the local repository. The refs
in the bundle will be stored under the hidden refs/bundle/*
namespace. This option is incompatible with --depth,
--shallow-since, and --shallow-exclude.

In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository.
Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be
absent.

Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp
and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
deprecated; do not use them).

The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

The following syntaxes may be used with them:

ssh://[<user>@]<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

git://<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

http[s]://<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

ftp[s]://<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

[<user>@]<host>:/<path-to-git-repo>

This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a
colon. For example the local path foo:bar could be specified as an
absolute path or ./foo:bar to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh
url.

The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~<username> expansion:

ssh://[<user>@]<host>[:<port>]/~<user>/<path-to-git-repo>

git://<host>[:<port>]/~<user>/<path-to-git-repo>

[<user>@]<host>:~<user>/<path-to-git-repo>

For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:

/path/to/repo.git/

file:///path/to/repo.git/

These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except the former implies
--local option.

git clone, git fetch and git pull, but not git push, will also
accept a suitable bundle file. See git-bundle[1].

When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the remote-<transport> remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax
may be used:

<transport>::<address>

where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
invoked. See gitremote-helpers[7] for details.

If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you
use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a
configuration section of the form:

For example, with this:

a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:

For example, with this:

a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
"ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.

Clone from upstream:

Make a local clone that borrows from the current directory, without checking things out:

Clone from upstream while borrowing from an existing local directory:

Create a bare repository to publish your changes to the public:

Clone a local repository from a different user:

Everything below this line in this section is selectively included
from the git-config[1] documentation. The content is the same
as what’s found there:

Specify the directory from which templates will be copied. (See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of git-init[1].)

Allows overriding the default branch name e.g. when initializing
a new repository.

Allows overriding the default object format for new repositories. See
--object-format= in git-init[1]. Both the command line option
and the GIT_DEFAULT_HASH environment variable take precedence over
this config.

Allows overriding the default ref storage format for new repositories.
See --ref-format= in git-init[1]. Both the command line
option and the GIT_DEFAULT_REF_FORMAT environment variable take
precedence over this config.

The name of the remote to create when cloning a repository.  Defaults to
origin.
It can be overridden by passing the --origin command-line
option.

Reject cloning a repository if it is a shallow one; this can be overridden by
passing the --reject-shallow option on the command line.

If a partial clone filter is provided (see --filter in
git-rev-list[1]) and --recurse-submodules is used, also apply
the filter to submodules.
