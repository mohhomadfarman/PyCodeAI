Title: Keyed collections - JavaScript | MDN

This chapter introduces collections of data which are indexed by a key; Map and Set objects contain elements which are iterable in the order of insertion.

A Map object is a key/value map that can iterate its elements in insertion order.

The following code shows some basic operations with a Map. See also the Map reference page for more examples and the complete API. You can use a for...of loop to return an array of [key, value] for each iteration.

Traditionally, objects have been used to map strings to values. Objects allow you to set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Map objects, however, have a few more advantages that make them better maps.

These three tips can help you to decide whether to use a Map or an Object:

A WeakMap is a collection of key/value pairs whose keys must be objects or non-registered symbols, with values of any arbitrary JavaScript type, and which does not create strong references to its keys. That is, an object's presence as a key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object from being garbage collected. Once an object used as a key has been collected, its corresponding values in any WeakMap become candidates for garbage collection as well â as long as they aren't strongly referred to elsewhere. The only primitive type that can be used as a WeakMap key is symbol â more specifically, non-registered symbols â because non-registered symbols are guaranteed to be unique and cannot be re-created.

The WeakMap API is essentially the same as the Map API. However, a WeakMap doesn't allow observing the liveness of its keys, which is why it doesn't allow enumeration. So there is no method to obtain a list of the keys in a WeakMap. If there were, the list would depend on the state of garbage collection, introducing non-determinism.

For more information and example code, see also "Why WeakMap?" on the WeakMap reference page.

One use case of WeakMap objects is to store private data for an object, or to hide implementation details. In the following example, the private data and methods belong inside the object and are stored in the privates object, which is a WeakMap. Everything exposed on the instance and prototype is public; everything else is inaccessible from the outside world because privates is not exported from the module.

Note:
This use case can now be implemented with classes and private fields.

Set objects are collections of unique values. You can iterate its elements in insertion order. A value in a Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.

The following code shows some basic operations with a Set. See also the Set reference page for more examples and the complete API.

You can create an Array from a Set using Array.from or the spread syntax. Also, the Set constructor accepts an Array to convert in the other direction.

Note:
Set objects store unique valuesâso any duplicate elements from an Array are deleted when converting!

Traditionally, a set of elements has been stored in arrays in JavaScript in a lot of situations. The Set object, however, has some advantages:

WeakSet objects are collections of garbage-collectable values, including objects and non-registered symbols. A value in the WeakSet may only occur once. It is unique in the WeakSet's collection.

The main differences to the Set object are:

The use cases of WeakSet objects are limited. They will not leak memory, so it can be safe to use DOM elements as a key and mark them for tracking purposes, for example.

Both the key equality of Map objects and the value equality of Set objects are based on the SameValueZero algorithm:
