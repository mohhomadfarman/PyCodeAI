Title: useContext – React
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext

useContext is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

Call useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.

See more examples below.

useContext returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest SomeContext above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the defaultValue you have passed to createContext for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.

Call useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.

useContext returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds the closest context provider above for that particular context.

To pass context to a Button, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider:

It doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the Button. When a Button anywhere inside of Form calls useContext(ThemeContext), it will receive "dark" as the value.

useContext() always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider providers in the component from which you’re calling useContext().

Often, you’ll want the context to change over time. To update context, combine it with state. Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the context value to the provider.

Now any Button inside of the provider will receive the current theme value. If you call setTheme to update the theme value that you pass to the provider, all Button components will re-render with the new 'light' value.

In this example, the MyApp component holds a state variable which is then passed to the ThemeContext provider. Checking the “Dark mode” checkbox updates the state. Changing the provided value re-renders all the components using that context.

Note that value="dark" passes the "dark" string, but value={theme} passes the value of the JavaScript theme variable with JSX curly braces. Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings.

If React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by useContext() will be equal to the default value that you specified when you created that context:

The default value never changes. If you want to update context, use it with state as described above.

Often, instead of null, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:

This way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.

In the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s outside any theme context provider and the default context theme value is 'light'. Try editing the default theme to be 'dark'.

You can override the context for a part of the tree by wrapping that part in a provider with a different value.

You can nest and override providers as many times as you need.

Here, the button inside the Footer receives a different context value ("light") than the buttons outside ("dark").

You can pass any values via context, including objects and functions.

Here, the context value is a JavaScript object with two properties, one of which is a function. Whenever MyApp re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a different object pointing at a different function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call useContext(AuthContext).

In smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like currentUser, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the login function with useCallback and wrap the object creation into useMemo. This is a performance optimization:

As a result of this change, even if MyApp needs to re-render, the components calling useContext(AuthContext) won’t need to re-render unless currentUser has changed.

Read more about useMemo and useCallback.

There are a few common ways that this can happen:

You might have a provider without a value in the tree:

If you forget to specify value, it’s like passing value={undefined}.

You may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:

In both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop value:

Note that the default value from your createContext(defaultValue) call is only used if there is no matching provider above at all. If there is a <SomeContext value={undefined}> component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling useContext(SomeContext) will receive undefined as the context value.
