Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

The docs are organized into 3 sections:

Use the sidebar to navigate through the sections, or search (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K) to quickly find a page.

Next.js has two different routers:

At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the App Router and the Pages Router docs.

The App Router and Pages Router handle React versions differently:

App Router: Uses React canary releases built-in, which include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks, prior to a new React release.

Pages Router: Uses the React version installed in your project's package.json.

This approach ensures new React features work reliably in the App Router while maintaining backwards compatibility for existing Pages Router applications.

Our documentation assumes some familiarity with web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

If you're new to React or need a refresher, we recommend starting with our React Foundations course, and the Next.js Foundations course that has you building an application as you learn.

For the best experience when using a screen reader, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.

If you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask our community on GitHub Discussions, Discord, X (Twitter), and Reddit.
