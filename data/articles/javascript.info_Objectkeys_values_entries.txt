Title: Object.keys, values, entries
Source: https://javascript.info/keys-values-entries

Let’s step away from the individual data structures and talk about the iterations over them.

In the previous chapter we saw methods map.keys(), map.values(), map.entries().

These methods are generic, there is a common agreement to use them for data structures. If we ever create a data structure of our own, we should implement them too.

They are supported for:

Plain objects also support similar methods, but the syntax is a bit different.

For plain objects, the following methods are available:

Please note the distinctions (compared to map for example):

The first difference is that we have to call Object.keys(obj), and not obj.keys().

Why so? The main reason is flexibility. Remember, objects are a base of all complex structures in JavaScript. So we may have an object of our own like data that implements its own data.values() method. And we still can call Object.values(data) on it.

The second difference is that Object.* methods return “real” array objects, not just an iterable. That’s mainly for historical reasons.

For instance:

Here’s an example of using Object.values to loop over property values:

Just like a for..in loop, these methods ignore properties that use Symbol(...) as keys.

Usually that’s convenient. But if we want symbolic keys too, then there’s a separate method Object.getOwnPropertySymbols that returns an array of only symbolic keys. Also, there exist a method Reflect.ownKeys(obj) that returns all keys.

Objects lack many methods that exist for arrays, e.g. map, filter and others.

If we’d like to apply them, then we can use Object.entries followed by Object.fromEntries:

For example, we have an object with prices, and would like to double them:

It may look difficult at first sight, but becomes easy to understand after you use it once or twice. We can make powerful chains of transforms this way.
