Title: F.prototype
Source: https://javascript.info/function-prototype

Remember, new objects can be created with a constructor function, like new F().

If F.prototype is an object, then the new operator uses it to set [[Prototype]] for the new object.

JavaScript had prototypal inheritance from the beginning. It was one of the core features of the language.

But in the old times, there was no direct access to it. The only thing that worked reliably was a "prototype" property of the constructor function, described in this chapter. So there are many scripts that still use it.

Please note that F.prototype here means a regular property named "prototype" on F. It sounds something similar to the term “prototype”, but here we really mean a regular property with this name.

Here’s the example:

Setting Rabbit.prototype = animal literally states the following: “When a new Rabbit is created, assign its [[Prototype]] to animal”.

That’s the resulting picture:

On the picture, "prototype" is a horizontal arrow, meaning a regular property, and [[Prototype]] is vertical, meaning the inheritance of rabbit from animal.

F.prototype property is only used when new F is called, it assigns [[Prototype]] of the new object.

If, after the creation, F.prototype property changes (F.prototype = <another object>), then new objects created by new F will have another object as [[Prototype]], but already existing objects keep the old one.

Every function has the "prototype" property even if we don’t supply it.

The default "prototype" is an object with the only property constructor that points back to the function itself.

Like this:

We can check it:

Naturally, if we do nothing, the constructor property is available to all rabbits through  [[Prototype]]:

We can use constructor property to create a new object using the same constructor as the existing one.

Like here:

That’s handy when we have an object, don’t know which constructor was used for it (e.g. it comes from a 3rd party library), and we need to create another one of the same kind.

But probably the most important thing about "constructor" is that…

…JavaScript itself does not ensure the right "constructor" value.

Yes, it exists in the default "prototype" for functions, but that’s all. What happens with it later – is totally on us.

In particular, if we replace the default prototype as a whole, then there will be no "constructor" in it.

For instance:

So, to keep the right "constructor" we can choose to add/remove properties to the default "prototype" instead of overwriting it as a whole:

Or, alternatively, recreate the constructor property manually:

In this chapter we briefly described the way of setting a [[Prototype]] for objects created via a constructor function. Later we’ll see more advanced programming patterns that rely on it.

Everything is quite simple, just a few notes to make things clear:

On regular objects the prototype is nothing special:

By default all functions have F.prototype = { constructor: F }, so we can get the constructor of an object by accessing its "constructor" property.
