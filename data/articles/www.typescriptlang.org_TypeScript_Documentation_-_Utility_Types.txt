Title: TypeScript: Documentation - Utility Types
Source: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html

TypeScript provides several utility types to facilitate common type transformations. These utilities are available globally.

Released:
4.5

This type is meant to model operations like await in async functions, or the
.then() method on Promises - specifically, the way that they recursively
unwrap Promises.

Released:
2.1

Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to optional. This utility will return a type that represents all subsets of a given type.

Released:
2.8

Constructs a type consisting of all properties of Type set to required. The opposite of Partial.

Released:
2.1

Constructs a type with all properties of Type set to readonly, meaning the properties of the constructed type cannot be reassigned.

This utility is useful for representing assignment expressions that will fail at runtime (i.e. when attempting to reassign properties of a frozen object).

Released:
2.1

Constructs an object type whose property keys are Keys and whose property values are Type. This utility can be used to map the properties of a type to another type.

Released:
2.1

Constructs a type by picking the set of properties Keys (string literal or union of string literals) from Type.

Released:
3.5

Constructs a type by picking all properties from Type and then removing Keys (string literal or union of string literals). The opposite of Pick.

Released:
2.8

Constructs a type by excluding from UnionType all union members that are assignable to ExcludedMembers.

Released:
2.8

Constructs a type by extracting from Type all union members that are assignable to Union.

Released:
2.8

Constructs a type by excluding null and undefined from Type.

Released:
3.1

Constructs a tuple type from the types used in the parameters of a function type Type.

For overloaded functions, this will be the parameters of the last signature; see Inferring Within Conditional Types.

Released:
3.1

Constructs a tuple or array type from the types of a constructor function type. It produces a tuple type with all the parameter types (or the type never if Type is not a function).

Released:
2.8

Constructs a type consisting of the return type of function Type.

For overloaded functions, this will be the return type of the last signature; see Inferring Within Conditional Types.

Released:
2.8

Constructs a type consisting of the instance type of a constructor function in Type.

Released:
5.4

Blocks inferences to the contained type. Other than blocking inferences, NoInfer<Type> is
identical to Type.

Released:
3.3

Extracts the type of the this parameter for a function type, or unknown if the function type has no this parameter.

Released:
3.3

Removes the this parameter from Type. If Type has no explicitly declared this parameter, the result is simply Type. Otherwise, a new function type with no this parameter is created from Type. Generics are erased and only the last overload signature is propagated into the new function type.

Released:
2.3

This utility does not return a transformed type. Instead, it serves as a marker for a contextual this type. Note that the noImplicitThis flag must be enabled to use this utility.

In the example above, the methods object in the argument to makeObject has a contextual type that includes ThisType<D & M> and therefore the type of this in methods within the methods object is { x: number, y: number } & { moveBy(dx: number, dy: number): void }. Notice how the type of the methods property simultaneously is an inference target and a source for the this type in methods.

The ThisType<T> marker interface is simply an empty interface declared in lib.d.ts. Beyond being recognized in the contextual type of an object literal, the interface acts like any empty interface.

To help with string manipulation around template string literals, TypeScript includes a set of types which can be used in string manipulation within the type system. You can find those in the Template Literal Types documentation.
